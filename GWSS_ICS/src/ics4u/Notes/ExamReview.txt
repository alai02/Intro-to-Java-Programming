Unit 2 - Object Oriented Programming 

Polymorphism and Inheritance

Intro
Inheritance extends on an existing class
Polymorphism is something you can do to classes that are being inherited
You might want to extend a class by adding more specific items into the object
A car class might be extended to “BMW” class where it has BMW specific methods and variables
Or a Circle class might be extended to “Disk” and accepts the input of height. 
Inheritance
Inheritance: when you extend classes from a “super class” to make it do more specific things
“allows a class to define a specialized type of an already existing class”
Is-a relationship: an extended class “is a” type of another class
BMW “is a” type of a car class. Disk “is a” type of circle class. 
Implementation:
extends: a keyword you must use to declare a “sub class”
this keyword will make it refer to the super class
public class <name> extends <superclass_name> { … }
base class: or “super class: is the class which this sub class is based on
derived class: or “sub class” often contains overridden methods or new data from the base class
super: is a keyword used to access methods in the base class
Ex. super(r) from the BMW class will call the constructor of the super class (car) , and pass variable r into it.
Members that are private cannot be accessed by derived classes
Hence, accessor methods are used to get values (ie getWeight(), getRadius())
Inherited Methods can be called directly.
If M3 is the object of BMW class, and you call carStart() from client code. If BMW class doesn’t have it’s own carStart() method, but Car class does, since BMW inherited the Car class, the client code doesn’t care and still executes carStart().
 Polymorphism
Polymorphism: an OOP property where objects have the ability to assume different types.
Polymorphism is based on inheritance
Since a subclass is derived from a super class, a super class object can reference an object of the subclass 
ie Car honda;
BMW 320i = new BMW(<arguments>);
honda = 320i  //honda now references 320i
Since BMW is inherited from Car class, any object made from Car can be “morphed” into another object made by a subclass of Car, in this case, a BMW 320i object.
Overridden methods from the super class can be called from the sub class.
From the earlier example, the method toString() originally in Car was overridden in BMW. Even though honda was made by Car class, then later morphed into a BMW object, I can still call the toString() method overridden by BMW. 
Abstract Classes
Abstract Classes: are used to model abstract concepts.
For example, a “vehicle” is an abstract object, you cannot have a “vehicle” vehicle. You can have cars, trucks, BMWs, Hondas which are in the form of vehicles.
Abstract classes are instantiated but do not represent the objects
They only have general details and actions of a type of object
Example: a Vehicle abstract class may only have number of wheels, or number of seats. Later, another class, like Car, can inherit the Vehicle class and add more details like colour, make, brand, etc.
abstract: Abstract classes are declared with abstract keyword
All abstract classes are intended to be inherited
Only public members of abstract classes are visible to derived objects
abstract class <class name> { .. }
Abstract Methods: methods declared with abstract keyword but contains no body
They are meant to be overridden in derived classes
abstract <return type>  <method name>(); 
Interfaces
Interface: a class with method declarations but no implementations
Interfaces cannot be inherited, they must be imported
Interfaces always has abstract methods
You can only implement an interface class, but it is not part of thehierarchy
<access level> interface <name> { .. methods .. }
Comparable Interface: one example of an interface in the java.lang package
CompareTo(Object obj) : returns 0 when obj is same as the object, a negative integer if obj is less than the object, and positive integer if obj is greater than the object.
A class must implement each method defined in the interface
Multiple Interfaces: A class can have multiple interfaces
When more than 1 interface is implemented, the interface names are separated by commas in the class declaration.
 

Unit 3 - GUIs and Event Driven Programming 

Intro
GUI are programs written with a visual interface using components such as frames, panels, labels, buttons, combo boxes, and text field
Event Driven Application: clicked actions done on the GUI will create an event
Event Handler: is a method run when the event is done 
Swing Package (javax.swing.*)
Swing package holds the APIs used for creating GUIs
Frame: is a window with a border, title, and buttons for minimizing, maximizing and closing the frame.
It is a top level container for the GUI, which holds and displays the components in a content frame
JFrame in the javax.swing.package package
setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(boolean): decorates the window with buttons
setDefaultCloseOperation(class_constant): tells the frame what to do when the user hits the close button, usually JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE
getContentPane(): returns the pane object
setContentPane(JPanel object): connect a panel to the frame
Pack(): sizes the frames so all components are at or above their preferred sizes
setVisible(boolean): displays the frame when true
Panel: a frame uses a pane to hold GUI components. JPanel is one way of adding or removing components
Add(Component GUIcomponent): adds a the component onto the pane, which also returns the index of the component in the pane
Remove(int index): removes the component at index value
Label: class for creating labels that can display text values
JLabel(string): constructor
JLabel(string, align_constant): creates JLabel objet with text and aligment LEADING or TRAILING aligning left or right respectively
setText(String): change the text of the label
Swing applications run it’s own thread dispatched in the main() method
Thread: a process that runs sequentially from start to finish.
GUIs should be invoked from an event-dispatching thread to ensure that each event-handler finishes executing before the next one executes.
Buttons: a clickable element which executes a task
JButton(String): creates a button with string as name provided
setActionCommand(String cmd): sets the name of the action performed when the button is clicked to cmd
getActionCommand(): returns name of action that has been performed by the button
addActionListener(object): adds object that listens for the user to click this component
Handling Events
Listener: is an object that listens for action events
Listeners require the java.awt.event.* import
When an action occurs, it executes the event handler named actionPerformed()
actionPerformed(ActionEvent event): has an ActionEvent parameter passed by the GUI when an event occurs
Action command: a string describing an event
Using this for the listener object will refer to the GUI’s object itself
To implement the ActionListener, we add implements ActionListener to the class declaration and then defining actionPerformed() method.
A constructor for the class will define and construct the buttons
A listener ActionPerformed method is created to handle the button actions
The actionPerformed will look for the event using the event.getActionCommand(); method 
Controlling Layout
Layout: refers to the arrangement of components in the GUI
Borders: are invisible, spaces that can be used to add padding around a component to give it distance from other components
Layout managers: determines the order of components on a content pane
FlowLayout: places them one next to another in a row, when a row gets too long, a new row is started (default)
BoxLayout: places components one after another in a column
GridLayout: places components into a grid of rows and columns
GridLayout(number of rows, number of columns, pixels between columns, pixels between rows)
GridLayout requires the java.awt.* statement
Alignment: refers to the placement of a component within a layout
setLayout(): used to specify a layout for the contentPane. BoxLayouts objects require arguments for arrangements. Vertical line layouts use PAGE_AXIS
setBorder(): specifies borders for the pane. BorderFactory object can specify different kinds of borders. createEmptyBorder() used for empty borders
setAlignment(): specifies the vertical alignment of the elements 
Getting Input from user
Text Fields: allow users to enter information and then be prompted to submit the data
JTextField(int col): constructor for a text field
JTextField(String, int col): creates a text field with a default text in the field
getText(): returns the string containing in the text in JTextField
addActionListener(object): adds an object that listens for the user to press the enter key
All data retrieved from the text field are Strings, you need to convert them to double or integer if you need it
java.lang.Double
parseDouble(String): returns double value of String
toString(double num): returns string representation of num
java.lang.Integer
parseInteger(String text): returns int value of the string
toString(int num): returns string representation of num 
Combo Boxes
Combo boxes offer users to select from a limited set of choices
JComboBox
JComboBox(Object[] items): constructor for combo box with an array of choices
setSelectedItem(int index): makes the item at index the selected item
getSelectedItem(): returns the String corresponding to the selected item
setEditable(boolean): allows text to be typed in the combo box
addActionListener(Object): adds object that listens for user to select an item from the component’s list
To handle events, you must have an event object casted to a JComboBox and then getSource(). Then you must retrieve the string in the combo box selected
JComboBox comboBox = (JComboBox)event.getSource();
String itemName = (String)comboBox.getSelectedItem();
These 2 lines are implemented in the actionPerformed method 
Colours
Color class is located in the java.awt.* package that allows you to change the colours of GUI elements
setBackground(Color.constant): sets the background color of a component to constant from the Color class
setForeground(Color.constant): sets the foreground color 
Images
Images can be added onto a JLabel or JButton element in the form of GIF or JPG
JLabel(ImageIcon pic): creates JLabel object with that picture
setIcon(ImageIcon pic): sets the JLabel with that picture
Similar for buttons, JButtons have JButton(String str, ImageIcon pic) to have picture and text
Using Nested Classes to Handle Events
Sometimes with many buttons, you might need multiple buttons to handle all the events
In such circumstances, a class can be created inside a class to handle those events
When declaring the class inside, be sure to implement ActionListener as well as refer to that class when you are making buttons/event GUI elements
